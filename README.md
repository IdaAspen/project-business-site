# Business Site

The assignment was to create a responsive buisness site with hero image and two sections with a form and an accordion.

## The problem
My plan was to have two different designs. A full background image on the tablet and hero imaage on desktop and mobile.

I used flexbox and different sections in the heading to be able to hide them in different media queries.

My main struggle was the tablet design and make the new heading appear over the backgroundimage.

By help from others, validation tools and stack overflow I did get it quite right.

However, I am still not satisfied with the outcome, I think I could have done more advanced functions but decided to scale down due to time schedule.
